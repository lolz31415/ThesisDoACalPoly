Various Thesis Documentation 

* Chapter 2 classical DOA information
* Chapter 4 Perturbations on Classical DOA Followed by simple Regression DCNN & Experiment Manager in MATLAB
* Note: The -90/+90 dataset did not work for DOA estimation due to a variety of reasons. Not enough data samples produced (2,000 samples per 50 average perturbation multipliers = 100,000) & mainly grating lobes
* The goal is to re-attempt this using a smaller range due to the ULA limitations maybe +/- 30° or similar and reduce the array perturbations to be a maximum of 0.25λ since this would at worst yield overlapping elements instead of elements with swapped positions in the array
